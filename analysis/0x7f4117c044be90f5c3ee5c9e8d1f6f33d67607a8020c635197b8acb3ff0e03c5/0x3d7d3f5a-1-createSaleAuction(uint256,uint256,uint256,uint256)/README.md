# Notes

It's hard to tell whether and why this is a false positive, because no source
code is available and the available decompiler don't seem to be able to cope
with a contract of that size.

We can analyze this transaction according to a little public information.
According to the [0xUniverse](https://0xuniverse.com/presskit/) homepage, there
are a couple of contracts involved in this game:

* 0x06a6a7af298129e3a2ab396c9c06f91d3c54aba8 is the "Planets" contract
* 0xe658e6eb4b478da2cf36d9e3712ba0c1b33786a1 is the "Planet Auction v2" contract
* ... (some more, not relevant for this transaction analysis)

In the transaction we flagged, we have a call chain 

```
0x06a6a7af298129e3a2ab396c9c06f91d3c54aba8  (Planets)
 | --> 0xe658e6eb4b478da2cf36d9e3712ba0c1b33786a1 (Planets Auction v2)
        | --> 0x06a6a7af298129e3a2ab396c9c06f91d3c54aba8 (Planets)
```

As both contracts are by the same developers, it is fair to assume that they
don't try to attack each other.

Here is a summary of relevant parts of the execution trace. As we can see the
storage address, which is write-locked by Sereum seems rather arbitrary, which
suggests this is part of a mapping variable. The locked variable stores the
address of the "Planet Auction v2" contract.
