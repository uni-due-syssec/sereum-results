No source available and decompiler don't work.

However, it is unlikely that this is a re-entrancy vulnerability.

1. The analyzed transaction only has a small calldepth and the transaction is
   flagged during call depth 1. Which means the EOA directly called the
   possible vulnerable contract. Typically the possibly vulnerable contract
   would be called from an attacker contract.
2. The call to the unknown calls a specific function with a very specific ABI
   (`receivePlayerInfo(uint256,address,bytes32,uint256)`). This suggests that
   this might be a trusted contract, which encapsulates different
   functionality.
