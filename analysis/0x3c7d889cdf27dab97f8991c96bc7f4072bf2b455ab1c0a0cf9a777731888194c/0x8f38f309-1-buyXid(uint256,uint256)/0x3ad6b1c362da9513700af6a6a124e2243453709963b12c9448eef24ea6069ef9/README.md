The flagged contract `0x0fc5` calls the `getPlayerID` function of the `0xf0bb`
contract. Then this contract, calls back into the flagged contract `0x0fc5` at
function `receivePlayerInfo(uint256,address,bytes32,uint256)`. 

It seems somehow the `receivePlayerInfo` loads from the storage address
`0xdcb48a...`, which currently contains 0, but also write to the same address
the value 9. This might be related to the value 8, which was passed as argument
to the `buyXid` function call. However, this might be coincidence.

Later the value 9 is again stored into the variable in the `buyXid` call, which
triggers Sereum.
